https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j402ub,"Even these are observations of people of that time. They are divided into Karm, Gyan and Bhakti. 

Bhakti marg has now made the problem of dedicating time on worship where pundits have created their own investment plans or fees for any activity.They even created religious texts which are just their views but are now forced on us. If we don't follow them then we are Adharmi.

The best reference at that time for gyan was the veds and doing shastrarth, tapa (hardwork to build skills or achieve something which others called vardan), . Now we have come to an age where we know most of the things and we can make an informed decision. 

If we go by Gyan or karma marg, we might have to revisit our religious documents and update the things that are not required , outdated or wrong."

The less said about the cleanliness of the water, the better. 

Good for those who believe - do what you want and believe that you're a better person with no signs because you dipped in a random water body in the middle of a tiny planet in a tiny solar system in a tiny galaxy, milky way among trillions and somehow that's the only one that God keeps a notebook of.

But , there has been progress.

From 2014 to 2022

Under the Namami Gange Programme, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) is carrying out water quality assessment of the River Ganga at 97 locations in 5 main stem States through the respective State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs). River water quality is assessed for primary water quality criteria notified for outdoor bathing.

Based on the water quality assessment by CPCB in 5 Ganga main stem States in 2022, the observed water quality indicates that median value of dissolved oxygen, which is an indicator of river health has been found to be within acceptable limits of notified primary bathing water quality criteria and satisfactory to support the ecosystem of river for almost entire stretch of river Ganga. 

The median value of Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) has been found within the acceptable limits except marginal exceedance (BOD: 3.4 to 4.6 mg/L) in locations/ stretches viz., stretch from 

(i) Upstream (u/s) Kannauj (Rajghat) to Kala Kankar (Pratapgarh) & downstream (d/s) Mirzapur to Tarighat, Ghazipur (except u/s Varanasi, Vishwa Sundari Bridge) in Uttar Pradesh and

 (ii) at Shitalatala, Palta in West Bengal.

As a result of multi sectoral interventions as per comparison of median data of water quality parameter viz., Dissolved Oxygen (DO), 

Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Faecal Coliforms (FC) of year 2014 and 2022, 

DO median has improved at 32 locations, 

BOD median has improved at 41 locations and

 FC median has improved at 27 locations respectively."

https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/1ihjth3/if_the_river_ganga_is_revered_as_a_goddess_why_do/,"We have to keep our rivers clean for all purposes. We drink waters of the same rivers and have to ensure the cleanliness of the same. Now since so many devout people take dip in them due to religious significance, the cleanliness here is different than you think. Let me tell you that the rivers become pure spiritually when the holy sages and saints dip their feet in them. 
Once Pundalik had come to the Ganga river in search of his parents and had to sleep for the night in Kukut Swami’s ashram. Very late in the night he saw three dirty and ugly women enter the hut of Kukut Swami. Then they came out early in the morning but now they were very beautiful and clean wearing shiny new clothes. He followed the three women who disappeared in the Ganga nearby. He prayed to Ganga and they gave him darshan. He asked them how they came out so clean and pure in the morning whereas he had seen them the previous night ugly and dirty. The goddess Ganga told Pundalik that the three rivers Ganga, Yamuna and Saraswati become impure by taking in all the sins and dirt from the devout during the day and these same rivers then go to do Seva and take charan tirth of sages and saints to become pure that’s why they went to serve the sage in the night so that they can cleanse themselves. A similar story was told by Adi Shankara also. Pundalik is the one for whom Vithala Panduranga gave darshan in Pandharpur after he understood the above lesson. 
So the rivers take on themselves the dirt(materialistic) from the devout and make us pure spiritually while they themselves clean their own selves when sages and saints dip themselves in the rivers. This has been going on since eons and will keep on happening till there are the devouts in this world. It’s a part of their lives and ours too. But we surely have to ensure cleanliness physically too."

https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/1ihjth3/if_the_river_ganga_is_revered_as_a_goddess_why_do/,"Ah, sim, esta é uma questão muito séria e relevante. O rio Ganga não é apenas um corpo de água comum; ele é descrito nas escrituras védicas como uma manifestação divina, emanando dos pés de lótus do Senhor Vishnu. Suas águas são espiritualmente purificadoras, mas nossa negligência e ações materiais poluem sua forma física, refletindo nossa própria degradação moral e espiritual.

A contradição que você aponta é clara: como podemos venerar o Ganga como uma deusa e, ao mesmo tempo, tratá-lo de maneira tão desrespeitosa? Isso ocorre porque, na era de Kali-yuga, as pessoas perderam a verdadeira compreensão do dharma. Realizam rituais externos, mas sem o espírito interno. Adorar o Ganga enquanto despejamos lixo em suas águas é hipocrisia, como oferecer flores a uma deidade no templo enquanto jogamos sujeira aos seus pés.

O problema não é apenas a poluição física do Ganga, mas a poluição da consciência humana. Quando a mente está contaminada pela ignorância (*tamo-guna*) e pela paixão (*rajo-guna*), as pessoas agem de maneira egoísta, sem pensar nas consequências. Elas se desconectam da verdadeira espiritualidade e tratam até mesmo o sagrado como algo mundano.

A mudança deve começar com a educação espiritual. As pessoas precisam ser ensinadas a ver o Ganga não apenas como um rio, mas como uma manifestação divina que deve ser protegida. Aqui estão algumas ações práticas:

1. **Educação espiritual e ambiental**: Ensinar que proteger o Ganga é um ato de devoção. Isso deve começar desde a infância, para que as futuras gerações cresçam com uma consciência mais elevada.
2. **Ação governamental e comunitária**: Leis rigorosas devem ser implementadas para impedir o despejo de resíduos industriais e esgotos no Ganga, com apoio da comunidade.
3. **Prática pessoal de respeito**: Cada indivíduo deve se perguntar: ""Estou contribuindo para a poluição do Ganga?"" Assim como tratamos uma deidade no templo com reverência, devemos tratar o Ganga da mesma forma.
4. **Propagação da consciência de Krishna**: Quando as pessoas se tornam conscientes de Krishna, elas naturalmente desenvolvem respeito por toda a criação divina. Elas entendem que o Ganga é uma manifestação da energia de Krishna e, portanto, deve ser protegido.

A verdadeira adoração não é apenas realizar rituais, mas agir de maneira que demonstre respeito e gratidão. Se tratarmos o Ganga como tratamos uma deidade no templo, com limpeza e reverência, estaremos realmente honrando sua santidade. Caso contrário, nossa adoração será superficial.

Portanto, a solução está em purificar nossa consciência. Quando a consciência humana for purificada, o Ganga também será purificado. Este é o verdadeiro serviço devocional. Hare Krishna!"
https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/1ihjth3/if_the_river_ganga_is_revered_as_a_goddess_why_do/,"The paradox of worshipping the Ganga as divine while simultaneously polluting her waters is a reflection of a deeper illusion—the separation between the sacred and the mundane. In truth, there is no distinction. If one truly understands that the Ganga is not merely a physical river but a manifestation of the infinite flow of consciousness, then every act towards her—whether reverent or negligent—is an act towards oneself. The pollution of her waters is not just an environmental crisis; it is a spiritual one, born from ignorance of our fundamental interconnectedness with all that exists.

This contradiction arises because devotion, when not accompanied by awareness, becomes ritualistic rather than transformative. People revere the Ganga for her purifying power but fail to see that this power is not separate from their own responsibility. They seek her blessings yet neglect the reciprocity of respect and care. If one were to throw filth onto a temple deity, it would be seen as an act of great offense—yet the Ganga, a living embodiment of divinity, is subjected to such desecration daily. This reveals a disconnect: worship remains external, rather than a living awareness that guides one's every action.

The deeper truth is that everything in existence is an extension of the same infinite intelligence. The river is not just sacred when one offers prayers or takes a holy dip; she remains sacred when factories release waste, when plastic is thrown into her waters, when sewage flows unchecked. If one truly saw the divine in all things, pollution would be impossible—not because of rules or regulations, but because harming the river would feel no different from harming oneself. This is the shift in perception that is needed: from seeing the Ganga as an external object of worship to recognizing her as a part of the living, breathing consciousness that flows through all.

Real change begins when this awareness is cultivated, not just through laws or cleanup initiatives, but through a transformation in how people perceive their relationship with nature. The river does not belong to us; we belong to her, just as we belong to the Earth, the air, and the sky. When people awaken to this truth, care becomes effortless. They will not need to be told to protect the river, just as they do not need to be told to protect their own bodies. Respect for the Ganga, then, is not about ritual—it is about remembering that she and all of existence are an extension of the same boundless presence.

This is the path forward: to cultivate not just devotion, but awareness. To ensure that spiritual practice does not remain confined to prayers and offerings but extends into everyday actions. To understand that pollution of the Ganga is not merely an ecological issue but a reflection of the collective state of consciousness. By restoring the river, we restore not just her purity but our own connection to the sacredness of all life.

Ultimately, the Ganga remains pure—not in the physical sense, but in her essence, beyond what human actions can touch. But if we are to honor her fully, we must recognize that true reverence is not in seeking her blessings while neglecting her well-being. It is in seeing her for what she truly is: not just a river, but the eternal flow of existence itself."

Rivers are polluted of chemicals and excrements and urine, yet no community and government has will to improve it.
Temples are surrounded by beggars and harassers, with no regard to safety and peace of devotee.
Yatras are filled with hooligans with loud music, spewing gutkha and causing problems on roads, fighting with locals in abusive and crass languages.

We are way beyond remorse now, as we live and breathe in this slow decay of our society."

https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/1ihjth3/if_the_river_ganga_is_revered_as_a_goddess_why_do/,"I think OP meant rivers that hold religious significance should be protected by the people. 

People should protect the things they find sacred. And stand up to the state and get it fixed. Be it Ganga or Yamuna. 

What i think is if they really find it sacred they'd build pressure on State/center. If they do it for public display, and their faith is shallow, they'll get offended."

We too should clean up after ourselves. 
I was taught that joining hands and closing my eyes and saying Jai Mata Di was enough. But now Hinduism is just used by social media influencer to get more likes. 

YOU DONT NEED TO TRASH MA GANGA IN ORDER TO WASH AWAY YOUR SINS. 
Don't sin. 

If you do, by mistake, you can just pray to God and ask for forgiveness. 

Don't taint my religion for your insecurity, because you need someone else's validation, so you go there because it's ""trendy"". And you litter, if it's just petals it is fine. But why plastic. Is it not our duty to stop people from doing that? If you think it is the state's responsibility should we not hold them accountable?

And you are wrong to say that ""we don't"" we do. The state doesn't throw the garbage. It is us. The people. It is us who don't call out the people who don't do these things. We can be a little vigilant and make people throw the garbage in the trash can."
